# NT-SYSTEM
### this is just a re-write of the original code in C, if you're staring this, might as well give the original coder some love as he's the one who came up with the idea

tool to get NT SYSTEM shell , its works by duplicating tokens of already running system processes , you can also specify a process . 
Usage :
run the following commands as admin
``` 
NT_sys_shell  //in this case it uses winlogon by default 
```
or
```
    NT_sys_shell Name_of_process 
```
